# Don Gato's Custom Layout

- Removed keys on the raise, lower, and adjust layers that duplicated keys on the main QWERTY layout.
- Moved the controll, alt, and gui keys to a more natural position.
- Added the Capslock key.
- Moved {}[], -_, \|, to be close to to similar keys on the QWERTY layout to make them esier to remember.
- Moved backspace and delete to make room for +=.
- Removed backlight and added an ADJUST key since I don't have backlighting.
