# Don Gato's Custom Layout

I have been programming with this keyboard layout at work and I found it much faster and eaiser to adjust to than the default layout.

- Removed keys on the RAISE, LOWER, and ADJUST layers that duplicated keys on the main QWERTY layout.
- Moved the controll, alt, and gui keys to a more natural position.
- Added the Capslock key on RAISE and LOWER in its possition on a standard keyboard.
- Moved {}[], -_, and \| (on RAISE and LOWER) to be close to to similar keys on the QWERTY layout to make them easier to remember. They are kept as close as possible to their locations on a standard layout so users won't have to ADJUST their muscle memmory much.
    - (), {}, and [] are all on the 9 and 0 keys. This is wher () are placed naturally, so it is easy to find all of your braces.
    - -_ are moved to the += key. Now you can remember that -, +, and = are all together. The keys are also right next to eachother on a standard layout, so it is avery small move.
    - \ and | have beeb moved to the /? key. Easy to remeber as / and \ are together.
- Moved backspace to make room for +=.
- Added delete to the backspace key on RAISE / LOWER
- Removed backlight and added an ADJUST key. As the massdrop kits don't come with backlighting default, I think this is more usefull for most users.
- I have left the Colemak and Dvorak alternate layouts, but they won't map up as conviently to the other layers.
